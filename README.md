# Case Study in R
The objective of this case study is to understand sales trends for one of the leading pharmaceutical company. The client would like to come see a du=ynamic dashboard with different KPI'S at different levels (National, Region & Territory etc). Create the below charts as these would help us explore the past data in a better manner and give a good picture of the progress and failures. This in turn would catalyse the decision-making process, making it easier, simpler and accurate.
